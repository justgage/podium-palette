import './podium.css';

You want to help work on Podium-CSS? Great üëèüòÅ! It's really easy to get
started and you only need to know HTML, CSS and maybe a little React.

## Setup

1. Clone the Repo down to your computer.
2. `npm install` the dependencies (if you don't have NPM go here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm or install through brew)
3. `npm start` should start the project, it'll usually run on 3001, or whatever port is available.

## Writing some documentation

> Lots of more documentation at the [docz website](https://docz.site/introduction).

All the files in this are written in MDX which is a Markdown/JSX mix. Meaning you
can write Markdown then intermingle React code without having to switch for instance:

```md
### A cool button

<button className="border-0 bg-red rounded text-white p-3">Example</button>
```

Would create:

---

### A cool button

<button className="border-0 bg-red rounded text-white p-3">Example</button>

---

If you want to wrap it in a code editor you can use the `<Playground>` tag:

```
import { Playground } from 'docz';

<Playground>
  <button className="border-0 bg-red rounded text-white p-3">Example</button>
</Playground>;
```

import { Playground } from 'docz';

<Playground>
  <button className="border-0 bg-red rounded text-white p-3">Example</button>
</Playground>

**NOTE:** ‚òùÔ∏è The above code is editable! Try changing the `bg-red` to `bg-blue`!

## Adding New Classes

> See official Tailwind docs on customization üëâüèª https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/#app

Adding classes can be done in multiple ways, just depends on the class you want to add.

### Adding Spacing, Colors, Breakpoints, Shadows, or Fonts

These all must be modified via the `tailwind.config.js` file.

For example, to change a color just add one to this section:

```js
/* tailwind.js */

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      black: '#000000',
      blue: '#4c76e0',
      darkBlue: '#2353cc',
      // Add yours here
      purple: '#558',
  // ...
```

After this you must run `npm build-css` and try it out!

### Adding Utility Classes (Animations, etc..)

If you don't find a section that looks like what you want in the `tailwind.js`
you can add a new one to the `src/main.css` file.

```css
.rotate-90 {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}
```

Then run `npm run build-css`.

#### Adding Higher level Classes

<span className="bg-mystic text-red py-3 px-4 rounded my-5 text-center">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Don't do this too much because it can bloat the CSS bundle
</span>

Generally you should avoid doing this because it makes the CSS bundle bigger and busts the cache.
But say you _reeeely_ want to have a `blue-box` class, maybe it's used it all over.

In Tailwind to create "composite class" (on class built out of others) you can add
it to the `main.css` file:

```css
/* main.css */
.blue-box {
  @apply shadow-md bg-blue text-white p-5;
}
```

Then run `npm run build-css` and then you should be able to use it:

```html
<div className="blue-box">...</div>
```

While it might be tempting to do this all over the place
every time you create a new class it increases your bundle size.
Also it might just be **premature abstraction** meaning, you may _think_ that you know blue boxes, only to find out in many cases
you want a different padding on them, or they aren't always blue
or some don't need a shadow, etc...

# Releasing to NPM

Currently we do `npm publish` locally. In the future it will auto-publish.
