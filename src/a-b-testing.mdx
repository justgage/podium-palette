<div class="bg-mystic text-red py-3 px-4 rounded my-5 text-center">
  ⚠️ Warning: This is broken right now, however probably wouldn't take much work
  to get working again.
  <br />I was just worried it bloated the CSS size for a feature that people aren't
  asking for yet.
</div>

A/B testing is a great way to test various designs.

<Playground>
  {/* try changing this to variant-b */}
  <div className="variant-a">
    <div className="b:hidden bg-red p-3">I'm the a-variant</div>
    <div className="a:hidden bg-blue p-3">I'm the b-variant</div>
  </div>
</Playground>

Also works for colors for simple swaps

<Playground>
  {/* try changing this to variant-a, or nothing */}
  <div className="variant-b">
    <div className="b:bg-blue bg-red p-3">Is Red better? or Blue?</div>
  </div>
</Playground>
