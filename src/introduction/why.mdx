# Why

This is the new Podium CSS. It's a `class` first UI library.

## What's `class` first?

This means we create CSS classes as a first class citisian _then_ React Components that
combine these classes for greater convienence.

First off we would create a bunch of classes

```css
/* NOTE: these aren't the actual implementations, just an example */

.rounded {
  border-radius: 3px;
}

.bg-red {
  background-color: red;
}

.text-white {
  color: white;
}

.shadow-md {
  box-shadow: /* whatever */ ;
}

.p-4 {
  padding: '32px';
}
```

Then we compose them in HTML

```html
<div class="rounded bg-red text-white shadow-md p-4">
  Warning! This could be much better!
</div>
```

Which looks like this:

<div class="rounded bg-red text-white shadow-md p-4">
  Warning! This could be much better!
</div>

Then if we want it to be reusable we wrap it up in a compnent:

```js
const ErrorBanner = ({ children }) => (
  <div className="rounded bg-red text-white shadow-md p-4">{children}</div>
);

// Later use it
<ErrorBanner> Warning! This could be much better! </ErrorBanner>;
```

## Why "`class` first"?

This is covered extensively in the [Values](/values-universal) section but at a high level:

1. It's Universal
2. It's Flexible
3. It's Consistent
4. It's Easy
