# Podium CSS

Podium CSS is a **Utility First CSS design system** built on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

To try it out use this code sandbox below and type some classes:

<Playground>
  <div className="bg-tan p-5 text-sm font-bold">
    Podium CSS is awesome. You can edit the code below
  </div>
</Playground>

Things to try:

- Change the padding to a smaller or a bigger number (`p-5` or `p-2`)
- Add rounded corners with `rounded` make it a pill with `rounded-full`
- Add a hover color with `hover:bg-red` and `hover:text-white`
- And a CSS transition with `transition-all`
- Make it responsive by adding `md:text-lg` to make the text bigger on anything bigger than a tablet
