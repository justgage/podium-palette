## So What's Podium CSS?

Podium CSS is a **Utility First CSS library** built on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

Basically this means it provides a **lot of little CSS classes** that you can conbine to create anything.

```css
/* NOTE: these aren't the actual implementations, just an example */

.shadow-md {
  box-shadow: /* whatever */ ;
}

.bg-blue {
  background-color: /* actual blue hash */ ;
}

.text-white {
  color: white;
}

.p-5 {
  padding: '16px';
}
```

Which would be then used like so:

<Playground>
  <div class="shadow-md bg-blue text-white p-5">A simple thing</div>
</Playground>

Creates:

Let's break that down...

- `shadow-md`: Adds a shadow, there's many of these.
- `bg-blue`: Makes the background color set to Podium's blue color.
- `text-white`: Sets the text color to white
- `p-5`: Sets the padding all around to the 5th step in the scale. Which is 16px.

## Long classNames

There's a couple of ways to combat when `className` gets too long in your HTML.

### 1. Abstract it into a component

The easiest way is use React (or any templating language) to abstract it into a Component.

```jsx
const BlueBox = ({children}) => (
  <div class="shadow-md bg-blue text-white p-5">
    {children}
  </div>
  );

const Main = <BlueBox>A simple thing<BlueBox>
```

This is nice because it doesn't bloat the CSS stylesheet, yet makes the HTML nicer.

### 2. Composite classNames

But say you _reeeely_ want to have a `blue-box` class, maybe it's used it all over.

In Tailwind to create composite class (on class built out of others) you can do this:

<span class="bg-mystic text-red py-3 px-4 rounded my-5 text-center">
  ⚠️ Warning: Don't do this too much because it can bloat the CSS bundle
</span>

```css
.blue-box {
  @apply shadow-md bg-blue text-white p-5;
}
```

Then you would be able to just do:

```html
<div class="blue-box">...</div>
```

While it might be tempting to do this all over the place
every time you create a new class it increases your bundle size.
Also it might just be **premature abstraction.**

You may _think_ that you know blue boxes, only to find out in many cases
you want a different padding on them, or they aren't always blue
or some don't need a shadow, etc...
