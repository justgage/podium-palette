# What Are Shortcuts?

Shortcuts could in some ways be thought of "components" but we decided to call them Shortcuts because
all they really do is make it so that you have to type less utility classes.

For the following two are equivalent:

import { Playground } from 'docz';
import '../podium.css';

<Playground>
  <button
    className={`
    border-0 rounded-sm transition-all font-semibold
    bg-blue text-white hover\:bg-darkBlue
    focus\:outline-none focus\:shadow-focus
    px-5 py-4 mr-4`}
  >
    Without Shortcuts
  </button>
  <button className="btn btn--primary px-5 py-4 mr-4">With Shortcuts</button>
</Playground>

However it's quite obvious that the latter is better than the first.

# When to use Shortcuts?

Using Shortcuts isn't without cost though. The primary cost is that they
cause the compiled stylesheet is bloated with duplicated styles but there
is also another, they are less obvious what exact styles they are applying.
With utility classes, you know exactly what CSS is being styled by just looking
at the names, this example for instance:

<Playground>
  <div className="bg-white shadow-md h-64 p-4">
    <span className="self-end">This should be at the end</span>
    <span className="self-center">I should be in the center</span>
    <span className="self-start">I should be at the start</span>
  </div>
</Playground>

It's plain to see that the reason the flexbox utilities aren't working is because
the parent doesn't have `flex` on it. Try adding it!

This wouldn't be as obvious if the root component had the class `card` or something.

I would use these rules when you try to figure out if it's a good idea, ask yourself:

> Have I used this exact combination of classes more then 10 times in real production code?
