## Riffing on old designs

The problem with tranditional components is that you have one
`<Banner/>` or one `<Button />` and there's not great way to make
your own without copy-and-pasting the existing one or starting
from scratch, or perhaps worst, CSS overrides (`!important` YOLO!).

**_However this is a natural and fine process of design!_** Not everything
has to be 100% uniform and often falls on it's face when you try to make
it that way. Every page and problem is different and needs to be treated
with care. However, **it shouldn't be completely lawless either**.

Podium CSS provides low-level classes that help you do just that.

For instance while you can use the `btn` classes like this (see [Button component](components-buttons))

import { Playground } from 'docz';
import '../output.css';

<Playground>
  <button className="btn btn--primary px-5 py-4 mr-4">Primary Button</button>
</Playground>

It's just as easy to make your own that's `tan` even though that didn't exist previously.

<Playground>
  <button className="btn bg-tan hover:bg-red hover:text-white px-5 py-4 mr-4">
    Marketing Button
  </button>
</Playground>
