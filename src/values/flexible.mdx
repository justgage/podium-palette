## Riffing on old designs

The problem with traditional components is that you have one
`<Banner/>` and there's not great way customize it without
hacky solutions such as:

1. CSS overrides ([#specifity-war](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html))
2. copy-and-pasting the existing one
3. starting from scratch

**_However this is a natural and fine process of design!_** Not everything
has to be 100% uniform and often falls on it's face when you try to make
it that way. Every page and problem is different and needs to be treated
with care. However, **it shouldn't be completely lawless either**.

Podium CSS provides low-level classes that help you do just that.

For instance while you can use the `btn` classes like this (see [Button component](components-buttons))

import { Playground } from 'docz';

<Playground>
  <button className="btn btn--primary px-5 py-4">Primary Button</button>
</Playground>

It's just as easy to make your own that's tan with a red hover _even though that didn't exist previously._

<Playground>
  <button className="btn bg-tan hover:bg-red hover:text-white px-5 py-4">
    Marketing Button
  </button>
</Playground>

And throw on some `uppercase` to make it even bolder.

<Playground>
  <button className="btn bg-tan hover:bg-red hover:text-white px-5 py-4 uppercase">
    Marketing Button
  </button>
</Playground>

How about some smaller text? (`text-sm`)

<Playground>
  <button className="btn bg-tan hover:bg-red hover:text-white px-5 py-4 uppercase text-sm">
    Marketing Button
  </button>
</Playground>

Now I need it to be in the center of the screen.

<Playground>
  <button className="btn bg-tan hover:bg-red hover:text-white px-5 py-4 uppercase text-sm mx-auto block">
    Marketing Button
  </button>
</Playground>

Maybe you feel that the classes are getting a little too long, however
you can always pull them off into a component or just break them onto
multiple lines to make it easier to read.

```jsx
<button
  className={[
    'btn',
    'bg-tan',
    'hover:bg-red',
    'hover:text-white',
    'px-5',
    'py-4',
    'uppercase',
    'text-sm',
    'mx-auto',
    'block'
  ].join(' ')}
>
  Marketing Button
</button>
```

## Easy to customize

Also it's flexible because it's easy to customize! If you wanted to add
a new color, spacing, font, etc... you would just add it to `tailwind.js`!
