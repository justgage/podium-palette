## ClassNames are far easier

What do you have to do to create a Styled Component?

1. Realize you need styling added to this div
2. Go into the `...StyledComponents.js` file, or create it
3. Think of a class name (variable name?) export it
4. Write the Custom CSS
5. Realize you need one of the Podium colors.
6. Look around in other files to figure out the `import` statement should look like
7. Pull in the colors you need and interoplate them into the css block
8. Go back over the React Component and import the Styled Component you wrote
9. Switch out your div for the styled Component
10. Check the browser to see if it looks good, make tweeks till it looks like the design.
11. Repeat.

**What about with Podium CSS?**

1. Realize you need styling added to this div
2. Write `className=...` and add your styles (note: colors are already availible).
3. Maybe look up these docs or the [Table of Styles](table-of-styles) to see what's availible.
4. Check the browser to see if it looks good
5. Repeat.

## Benefits

Namely the benefits you gain are:

1. Don't have to `import` anything to use the design system.
2. Don't have to cross-reference a CSS file and a JS file
3. Using the design system in the browser now possible.

## Designing in the Browser

Because of the nature CSS-in-JS it wasn't really possible to design in the browser _using the design system_.
Now it's easy:

import '../podium.css';
import designGif from '../design-in-browser.gif';

<img className="bg-black w-full block shadow" src={designGif} />
