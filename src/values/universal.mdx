News Flash **Not everything can use Styled Components**!

Ok, it's not just Styled Components, really **any** CSS-in-JS, or better CSS-in-React. Styled Components, CSS modules,
and the like all have one central problem, **it can't be used by plain HTML** and it often can't be used if it's not part
of your build pipeline.

## Where CSS-in-JS breaks down

### Webchat

import webchat from './webchat.png';

<img className="bg-black w-full block" src={webchat} />

Webchat can't use styled components because it has to be rendered
inside an inline-iframe. The inline iframe is controlled from the
**outside** which _means_ that Styled Components trys to put the
`<style>` tag in the head of our customer's page instead of inside
the iframe. [Which at the time was not configurable.](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/659)

### Third-Party apps building inside of Messenger

import thirdParty from './3rd-party.png';

<img className="bg-black w-full block shadow" src={thirdParty} />

When people are building inside of messenger we aren't going to dictate
they can only use React, they might use sever rendered HTML or Angular,
or Ember (heaven help them). Providing an easy library where they can create
anything but still make it easy for them to make things look on Brand makes sense.

### Dashboard Frontend & Stormcrow (login page)

Dashboard Frontend is built in Angular, Stormcrow's frontend is
built in plain JS, no React. This means they can't use Podium UI.
You can argue that they should be rewritten in React, which is
probably true, however it doesn't seem to be Podium's priority right
now.

### Podium.com

Podium.com is written in Wordpress. Because of this it's styles tend to differ
from our app's styles. It couldn't use React without causing the page
to load slower.

## Just CSS & HTML

CSS & HTML is what we all share, therefore using Podium CSS should make that
experience the best.
