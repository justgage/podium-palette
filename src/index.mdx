# Podium CSS

This is the new Podium CSS. It's a CSS first UI library.

## Why "CSS First"?

The main reason is **_because everything can't be styled components_**!

There's a couple of reasons why this is, let's look at some examples.

### Webchat

Webchat can't use styled components because it has to be renderd
inside an inline-iframe. The inline iframe is controlled from the
**outside** which _means_ that Styled Components trys to put the
`<style>` tag in the head of our customer's page instead of inside
the iframe. [Which at the time was not configurable.](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/659)

### Dashboard Frontend & Stormcrow (login page)

Dashboard Frontend is built in Angular, Stormcrow's frontend is
built in plain JS, no React. This means they can't use Podium UI.
You can argue that they should be rewritten in React, which is
probably true, however it doesn't seem to be Podium's priority right
now.

### Podium.com

Podium.com is written in Wordpress. As such often it's styles differ
from our app's styles. It couldn't use React without causing the page
to load slower.

### Third-Party apps building inside of Messenger

When people are building inside of messenger we aren't going to dictate
they can only use React, they might use sever rendered HTML or Angular,
or Ember (heaven help them). Providing an easy library where they can create
anything but still make it easy for them to make things look on Brand makes sense.

## So What's Podium CSS?

Podium CSS is a **Utility First css library** built on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). Basically
this means it provides a lot of little css classes that you can conbine to create anything.

For instance:

```html
<div class="shadow-md bg-blue text-white p-5">A simple thing</div>
```

Creates:

<div class="shadow-md bg-blue text-white p-5">A simple thing</div>

Let's break that down...

- `shadow-md`: Adds a shadow, there's many of these.
- `bg-blue`: Makes the background color set to Podium's blue color.
- `text-white`: Sets the text color to white
- `p-5`: Sets the padding all around to the 5th step in the scale. This one ends up being `16px`.

But Why do this instead of `blue-box`, Or something like that? Well we can still do that. In tailwind
to create higher level classes you can do this:

```css
.blue-box {
  @apply shadow-md bg-blue text-white p-5;
}
```

Then you would be able to just do:

```html
<div class="blue-box">...</div>
```

**_However_** this should be done **very sparingly**!

While it might be tempting to do this all over the place
every time you create a new class it increases your bundle size.
Also it might just be **premature abstraction.**

You may _think_ that you know blue boxes, only to find out in many cases
you want a different padding on them, or they aren't always blue
or some don't need a shadow, etc...
