# Why Podium CSS

This is the new Podium CSS. It's a CSS first UI library.

## Why "CSS First"?

The main reason is **_because everything can't be styled components_**!

There's a couple of reasons why this is, let's look at some examples.

## Everything can't use Styled Components

#### Webchat

Webchat can't use styled components because it has to be renderd
inside an inline-iframe. The inline iframe is controlled from the
**outside** which _means_ that Styled Components trys to put the
`<style>` tag in the head of our customer's page instead of inside
the iframe. [Which at the time was not configurable.](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/659)

#### Third-Party apps building inside of Messenger

When people are building inside of messenger we aren't going to dictate
they can only use React, they might use sever rendered HTML or Angular,
or Ember (heaven help them). Providing an easy library where they can create
anything but still make it easy for them to make things look on Brand makes sense.

#### Dashboard Frontend & Stormcrow (login page)

Dashboard Frontend is built in Angular, Stormcrow's frontend is
built in plain JS, no React. This means they can't use Podium UI.
You can argue that they should be rewritten in React, which is
probably true, however it doesn't seem to be Podium's priority right
now.

#### Podium.com

Podium.com is written in Wordpress. Because of this it's styles tend to differ
from our app's styles. It couldn't use React without causing the page
to load slower.

## Some other reasons

Other reasons include:

- CSS classes are easier to compose together than components
- Using CSS files means potential to cache the CSS independently from the JavaScript
- If you use the CDN version of Podium CSS
